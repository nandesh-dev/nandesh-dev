## Heya! I am Nandesh
A software developer ( and a UI designer? ) who loves trying out new things.

### Software
I enjoy stepping out of the cave of "one-framework-for-everything" and exploring whatâ€™s best for each task.

  <tr>
    <td>
      <h4>Javascript / Typescript</h4>
      <p>I started out my journey with Javascript messing around with HTML canvas and 2D graphics. Now it works well for many frontends with / without React.</p>

    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <h4>Golang</h4>
      <p>Go has been a great tool to build performant backend while also being quick to code in.</p>
    </td>

  </tr>

I have also worked with Python, Rust, Ruby on Rails, Arduino, Lua while working with other developers.
